# NLP-Powered-Stylist-Chatbot ðŸ’¬ðŸ§¥

**Bella** is a basic stylist chatbot built with Python, AIML, Flask, and NLTK. It extracts keywords using tokenization and POS tagging, then suggests outfits based on gender, occasion, weather, or season.

This was my semester project to learn how NLP pipelines and simple chatbot logic work in practice.

## ðŸš€ How to run
- Clone the repo  
- Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)  
- Put your AIML files inside `/aiml_files`  
- Run `app.py`  
- Open `localhost:5000` in your browser

**Not a production chatbot â€” just a learning project to understand NLP basics + chatbot flow!**
