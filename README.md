# NLP-Powered-Stylist-Chatbot ðŸ’¬ðŸ§¥

**Bella** is a simple stylist chatbot built with **Python**, **AIML**, **Flask**, and **NLTK**.  
It extracts keywords using tokenization and POS tagging, then suggests outfits based on **gender**, **occasion**, **weather**, or **season**.

This was a semester project assigned by my professor to help me practically apply NLP basics and understand how to connect a chatbot backend with a simple web interface.
